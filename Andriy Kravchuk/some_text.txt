Here is "My little pony" song:

My Little Pony, My Little Pony
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
(My Little Pony)
I used to wonder what friendship could be
(My Little Pony)
Until you all shared its magic with me
Big adventure, tons of fun

A beautiful heart, faith full and strong
Sharing kindness, it's an easy feat
And magic makes it all complete

Yeah, My Little Pony
Don't you know you're all my very best friends

Here is "Rise" song:

All I see is, shattered pieces
I can't keep it, hidden like a secret
I can't look away
From all this pain, in the world we've made
Every day you need, a bulletproof vest
To save yourself, from what you could never guess
Am I safe today?
When I step outside, in the wars we wage
Our future's here and now
Here comes the countdown
Sound it off, this is our call
Rise and Revolution
It's our time to change it all
Rise and Revolution
Unite, and Fight
To make a better life
Everybody, one for all
Sound off, this is the call
Tonight, We Rise, Rise
Tonight, We Rise, Rise
Tonight, We Rise
Like a hand grenade, thrown in a hurricane
Spinning in chaos, trying to escape the flame
Yesterday is gone
Faster than the blast of a car bomb
And when the scars heal, the pain passes
As hopeâ€¦
