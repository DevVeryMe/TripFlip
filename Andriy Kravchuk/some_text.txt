Here is "My little pony" song:

My Little Pony, My Little Pony
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
(My Little Pony)
I used to wonder what friendship could be
(My Little Pony)
Until you all shared its magic with me
Big adventure, tons of fun

A beautiful heart, faith full and strong
Sharing kindness, it's an easy feat
And magic makes it all complete

Yeah, My Little Pony
Don't you know you're all my very best friends
