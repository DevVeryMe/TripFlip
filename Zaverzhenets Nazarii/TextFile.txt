I enjoy watching TV shows in my spare time. There are such as the big bang theory and friends. 
I watch these TV shows in English with English subtitles as it improves and trains my listening skills and reading skills very well because at the same time 
as I am listening I am also reading the text on my computer screen and I try to write down all the unfamiliar words and later 
I try to remember them because it trains my memory very well.
